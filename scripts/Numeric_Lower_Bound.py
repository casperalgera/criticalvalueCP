First initialise key variables.  The variable initial is a dictionary that has all frontiers in a step, 
with the associated probability. In this dictionary, zeroes denote infected sites, crosses healthy ones.
The max number of iterations the program will run is stored in d. For the sympy algebra we define a 
symbol lambda.
